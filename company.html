      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>NoteX Studios is an indie game studio with a mission to break the limits of creativity. We’re a passionate team of developers, designers, artists, storytellers, and innovators who have come together to build games that don’t just entertain — they leave an impact.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating immersive story-based games with original narratives, atmospheric environments, and deep gameplay experiences.</li>
        <li>Developing high-quality, modular 2D and 3D assets for creators, available soon through our own curated platform — the NoteX Asset Store.</li>
        <li>Bringing together a global team of like-minded beginners and intermediates who are hungry to learn, create, and level up together.</li>
        <li>Experimenting with ideas beyond the typical — including horror, sci-fi, mythological fiction, and unique gameplay mechanics that give each project its own identity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are just getting started, but our goals are massive. From launching original IPs to supporting the developer community with valuable tools and assets, everything we do is rooted in passion, dedication, and ambition.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a player, a creator, or someone chasing the same dream — NoteX Studios is a place where visions come to life.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>At NoteX Studios, we envision a future where creative freedom meets bold execution. We believe that great games aren’t born from big budgets — they’re born from bold ideas, team spirit, and the willingness to build something that’s never been done before.</p>
    <p>We started this studio just days ago — from scratch — with a dream to create AAA-quality experiences with a fresh, self-taught team. We are not backed by massive publishers. What we have is a tight-knit community of creatives who are all in for the journey, not just the reward.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Empower emerging talent: especially beginners and intermediates who are often overlooked by big studios.</li>
      <li>Encourage learning through doing: every project is a chance to improve, grow, and make something incredible.</li>
      <li>Build a self-sustaining creative ecosystem: where everyone contributes, shares, and benefits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We're not offering salaries (yet), but we promise something even more valuable — real experience, real collaboration, and a share in the success you help create. If your work gets us paid, you get paid. It’s that simple.</p>
    <p>We’re not just building games. We’re building a movement.</p>

    <h2>Join Us</h2>
    <p>At NoteX Studios, we’re not just making games — We’re building a dream from zero — and you're invited to be one of the founding creators.</p>
    <p>We are a newly-formed indie game studio working on AAA-level titles and our own asset store. Our team is small, passionate, and burning with ideas. We're not looking for the "perfect portfolio" — we're searching for creators who care, who are ready to learn, build, and grow with us.</p>
